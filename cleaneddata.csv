- Meeting with Zeinab to support her with the logitech certification call & guiding her on how to direct conversation favorably

- Long workshop with Alaa on Material 3 Mobile app UI rework

- Meeting with Usama regarding needing Soliman free with me so that we can continue working on the components, blocks and sections, as working with someone else without Soliman at the very least will set us back quite a bit of time right now, till the systems are ready to be handed over. 

- Discussed with Soliman the plan going forward for the new stack and how we'll approach the new blocks at version 2, while also studying the new approach so that we can start to craft in-house components, blocks and sections of our own by relying on pre-made atomics, avoiding any code issues that we faced before. 

- Long meeting with Eman discussing at length the same things I discussed with Soliman & Eweida so that she is up to date, that way she is aligned and prepared in case Sara & I require support, since she already has experience shadcn and is already working on a landing page concept for the developer ecosystem. I will await a follow-up so that we can further align as Soliman, Sara & I develop the system.

- Took time to research, document & retrace old component libraries to start establishing a good pool to use, due to the overload of links causing confusion. I am adding it now to the lifeline Notion v1.5

- Follow-ups with Dev to ensure Communication landing page is tested and in production as planned by tonight, however it is yet to be tested to do some repo issues, so I discussed the situation with Usama & he informed me he has a workaround in mind temporarily so that testing can proceed unhampered in the meantime while they sort the repo issues. Soliman has informed me I should expect the link possibly tonight or tomorrow morning, so I will check in on what caused the delay so that we can resolve any lingering issues earlier in the future.",nan,2024-07-29,18:00:04.500000

- Multiple long workshops + supporting Alaa to audit, approved most screens with some comments for Alaa to adjust before checking with Abdelghaffar.

- Thorough meetings with Omar & Eslam about onboarding, commented about issues with current implementation from a user journey perspective due to lack of step indicator and seemingly random placement of next button

- Semi-long meeting with Amira about future landing pages, showing her a sample of components and blocks that we've found. We agreed that I will discuss with Dev blocks to use at my discretion, adhering where needed to any case-specific requirements. Amira has sent me a preliminary list for me to get started with in planning the comparison page while the content is being crafted. We agreed that while the content is prepared, we will be preparing the pages version 2 of the components.

- Supporting Eman with landing pages design for Dev ecosystem providing links & resources

- Long & very thorough research on more components, resources and tools to expedite work speed for dev & product team

- Follow ups with Dev over issues with pushing the landing page for testing, issue persisted since the morning and till now have not received confirmation that the issue will be solved by a specific deadline, as there seems to be a critical issue with the Pipeline affecting other projects as well currently being worked on, delaying the landing page troubleshooting.

Date: 7/30/2024    Time: 1 pm  

Attendants:  Masrya, Samir, Mohand and Eman   

  

Discussion:  

-We compared between the two different approaches: which one should we prioritize first, and what's the best way to proceed in the coming period? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each path, and which one will save us time and provide faster returns? 

Our options are to: 

 -release a meet SaaS-like classroom or to work on separating the dashboard. We discussed this in our last meeting with El-Gammal, Ahmed Osama and El-Saman who suggested that the innovation team needs to hold a meeting to discuss these details in order to determine the best practices. Based on that, we can start building our plan and defining our goals. 
 

-We've identified high-priority tasks that must be completed this week: 

 resolving API Management bugs, completing documentation enhancements, and launching the comparison feature table. 

 -Additionally, we agreed that separating the education API and Classroom API is essential. Samir indicated that he needs two days to research the best way to implement this. 

 

ACTION PLAN: We need to schedule a meeting to discuss all these details so we can create a clear and organized plan for the new month.""

- Very long & thorough workshop with Hesham & Sara on Landing Page, he's mostly done with English, just some functionalities remaining, and animations work for the hero section. Currently the only section missing is the comparison section, as that one does not have a ready component. However, Sara & I have been researching and found a few viable ""Donor"" components, from which we can derive shadcn atomics that could build a good comparison component to use in the comparison section, At the moment however, since the animations took a bit longer than expected since they did not behave as expected, and required hesham to adjust it a few times with us, we'll focus on the current form of the page and avoid additions. Once the page is done in both arabic and english and a retrospective was done, we can consider what we believe is missing and compare that to the conversion.
